# Prime Number Finder
###### In this program I'll demonstrate my thinking to show how a method can be gradually improved to much more efficiently find all prime numbers up to a limit

## How to use

- This is a simple Java program and doesn't need any external requirements to run
- Start by reading the comments in the Main class
- Read through my comments in the PrimeNumberFinder class to follow along as I explain how I'm making improvements to the code
- Return to the Main class each time a new and improved method is created to test running it and see how it compares to the previous methods
